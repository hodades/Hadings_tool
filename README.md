## Courses

* [Course 1: Introduction to Python](Courses/Course_1.ipynb)
  
  Offers an overview of Python, covering its history, significance, and potentially involves writing initial Python code. It serves as an entry point to Python programming.
  
* [Course 2: Variables](Courses/course2.ipynb)
  
  Explores the concept of variables, teaching how to declare, assign values to, and manipulate them. This lays the foundation for more complex operations.
  
* [Course 3: Data Types](Courses/Course_3.ipynb)
  
  Delves into various data types in Python, including strings, integers, floats, and lists. Understanding these types is crucial for effective data manipulation and versatile programming.
  
* [Course 4: Further informations](Courses/course_4.ipynb)
  
  Acts as a knowledge booster, covering advanced Python concepts, coding best practices, and pointing to additional resources for a deeper understanding.

## Exercises

Additionally, there are practical exercises (Activity 1-4) accompanying each course, providing hands-on coding experience to reinforce theoretical knowledge. 

* [Activity 1](Activity/activity_1.py)

In this notebook, you're tackling two activities. In the first, you work with variables, perform calculations for monthly and yearly savings, manipulate strings, and create a function for calculating height with a hat. The second activity focuses on currency conversion, where you define functions to convert between euros and dollars, conduct tests, and create a flexible function for switching between the two conversions based on a specified currency. These activities showcase a range of programming concepts, from basic arithmetic to function definition and conditional logic. 

* [Activity 2](Activity/activity_2.py)

Sure! In this notebook, the focus is on conditional statements and list manipulation. In the first activity, a function is_even() is defined to check if a given number is even. The second activity involves creating and manipulating a list of room areas in a house. Room names and areas are combined in the list, and operations such as accessing specific elements, calculating sums, and creating a function to retrieve room areas based on names are performed. The activities showcase practical applications of conditionals and list handling in a programming context. 

* [Activity 3](Activity/Activity_3.ipynb)

This notebook explores fundamental Python programming concepts, emphasizing while loops, functions, and dictionaries. In the "While Loop" section, contributors implement functions to print odd or even numbers up to a given limit using different approaches. The "Dictionary" section introduces functions that transform dictionaries by converting keys to lowercase and doubling values. The "Homework" section presents functions for adjusting speed and identifying customers who made purchases but haven't subscribed to a newsletter, showcasing practical applications of conditionals and dictionary manipulation. 

* [Activity 4](Activity/Activity_4.ipynb)

The Activity concluded with a demonstration of the power of loops, using both for loops and list comprehensions to iterate through data structures efficiently. The latter, in particular, proved to be a concise and expressive way to generate lists based on specific conditions.
