## Courses

* [Course 1: Introduction to Python](Courses/Course_1.ipynb)
  Offers an overview of Python, covering its history, significance, and potentially involves writing initial Python code. It serves as an entry point to Python programming.
* [Course 2: Variables](Courses/course2.ipynb)
  Explores the concept of variables, teaching how to declare, assign values to, and manipulate them. This lays the foundation for more complex operations.
* [Course 3: Data Types](Courses/Course_3.ipynb)
  Delves into various data types in Python, including strings, integers, floats, and lists. Understanding these types is crucial for effective data manipulation and versatile programming.
* [Course 4: Further informations](Courses/course_4.ipynb)
  Acts as a knowledge booster, covering advanced Python concepts, coding best practices, and pointing to additional resources for a deeper understanding.
