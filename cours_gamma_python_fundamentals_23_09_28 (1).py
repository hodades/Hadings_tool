# WHILE LOOP
##How do you use while in Python?
A while loop is used to repeatedly execute the indented block of code as long as the True-False condition following the word 'while' evaluates to True. It is ideal for situations where the total number of iterations necessary cannot be defined beforehand, such as obtaining user input and checking it until correct input is entered.

##What is a while statement in Python?
The word 'while' in Python is a reserved word which creates a while loop using the syntax: while condition: do_stuff. If do_stuff is more than one line, it should be put on the next line and indented. The 'condition' is evaluated before each iteration of the loop, and 'do_stuff' is executed so long as 'condition' is true.

##What is a while loop Python?
A while loop has the syntax 'while condition: do_stuff' where 'do_stuff' is usually placed on the next line and indented. It executes the statements in 'do_stuff' repeatedly so long as 'condition' is true.

"""# Dictionary
## What is a dictionary?
Dictionaries are Python’s implementation of a data structure that is more generally known as an associative array. <br>
A dictionary consists of a collection of key-value pairs. Each key-value pair maps the key to its associated value.

## How do you define a dictionnary?
You can define a dictionary by enclosing a comma-separated list of key-value pairs in curly braces ({}).<br>
A colon (:) separates each key from its associated value:

## What is a Boolean?
Python boolean type is one of the built-in data types provided by Python, which represents one of the two values i.e. True or False.

##What do we use it for?
Generally, it is used to represent the truth values of the expressions. For example, 1==1 is True whereas 2<1 is False.

##Technical assets
The boolean value can be of two types only i.e. either True or False. The output <class ‘bool’> indicates the variable is a boolean data type.

It will work exactly like the **WHERE** clause in SQL
